	Updated version of the Hyper-V storage, network, and mouse drivers
	from those planned for v3.4.  The drivers in v3.2 simply do not
	work correctly dropping access to the drive after a few seconds
	of sustained use.  Testing with the Azure folk showed that the
	v3.4 drivers worked well in the v3.2 codebase.	Intial version
	from linux-next pre-merge window, update from v3.4-stable once
	it releases.
